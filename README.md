# Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a patient will suffer from diabetic retinopathy based on blood test features. It is a binary classification problem where the target variable (prognosis) has values 0 (no retinopathy) or 1 (retinopathy). The dataset consists of 6000 instances and 6 variables.

## Dataset Details
- **ID**: Numeric identifier
- **Age**: Numeric feature
- **Systolic Blood Pressure**: (Normal range: <120mmHg)
- **Diastolic Blood Pressure**: (Normal range: <80mmHg)
- **Cholesterol**: (Normal range: 125-200 mg/dl)
- **Prognosis**: Target variable (0 or 1)

## Project Goals
- Develop a machine learning model to classify patients into diabetic retinopathy risk categories.
- Implement the model using Python and ML frameworks.
- Deploy the solution using tools like Streamlit for accessibility.


## Deployment
The final model will be deployed using Streamlit or similar frameworks for interactive visualization.
